# USD Probability and Statistics for Artificial Intelligence (AAI-500-02) Final Project 
In this repository, we'll be using a [NHCS dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/drug-use-data-from-selected-hospitals-26ee4) on patient use of drugs to understand patterns of health care delivery and utilization in the U.S. with a focus on opioid and drug overdose from 2020-2023.

For our final project, we'll perform the following operations on this dataset:
- Data Cleaning/Preparation
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Model Selection
- Model Analysis
- Conclusion and Recommendations.

## Dataset Overview
The NHCS collects data on patient care in hospital-based settings to offer insights into health care delivery patterns in the U.S. While the data from 2020-2023 is preliminary and not nationally representative, it can provide valuable insights into the use of opioids and other overdose drugs.

## Dataset Summary
- Data from 25 hospitals for inpatient and 25 hospitals for emergency departments (ED).
- Data spans from January 1, 2020, to May 27, 2023.
- The dataset includes information on various indicators related to drug use, such as overall drug use, comorbidities, drug, and polydrug overdose.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Folder containing the raw data.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, model selection, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file.
